### Notes

Review of RNN

 - First hidden state is zero vectors or identity matrix
 - Very deep RNNs can have diminishing gradients, particularly for earlier layers
 - Back prop through time: Through away history of operations after every update
 - More gradient layers cause issues with large / small gradients
