 - Collaborative filtering
 - In depth for the above

### Notes

Data sources

 - Kaggle
   - Using `kaggle-cli`
   - Submission format depends on competition
 - Anywhere else

Quick set up

 - Load data w/ fast.ai
 - Get transformations, pre-trained model

Other libraries

 - Keras
 - Lesson 1 available in Keras now

Convolutions

 - Example, using excel
 - Introduction to ReLU, as max(0, value)
 - Layer naming conventions
 - Introduction to softmax: Individual values in [0,1], sum of values = 1. Useful for output layers

Lesson 2 notebook

 - Features: weather, agriculture, water, primary rain forest
 - Predicting multiple labels

Structured data
 - Unstructured: Data elements are same type
 - Structured: Many data types

Lesson3-Rossman

 - Get file
 - Read in CSV
 - ETL pipeline
