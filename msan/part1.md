# Notes

## Part 1

Niceties
 
 - Yannett is RA
 - 100 in room, 400 international, 100 students

Tech

 - [http://forums.fast.ai/](http://forums.fast.ai/) for communication. 
 - Crestle (sp?): Website to launch GPU instances
 - He's restarting the server

Recordings will be available in ~24 hours in un-edited form.
 - Will be available at course.fast.ai

Context

 - Arthur Samules (?)
 - Intro to ML: train machine to solve problems
 - Example: Breast cancern 5 year survival. Ensembled, hand crafted features and sub-models
 - Style transfer example
 - Google data center cooling cost decrease w/ ai model
 - Alpha go example
 - Variation in student's background

Deep learning fundamentals

 - Flexible functions
 - Paramter fitting
 - Gradient descent
 - Local minima tend to be similar in high dimmensionality spaces
 - GPUs work well for DL, because they are both (primarily) matrix math

Learning method

 - Start w/ high level, dive into inner workings
 - Time expectation: Minimum 10 hours, but some will be all in
 - Focus on hands on coding, minimize theoretical / paper based learning

Architectures

 - CNNs
 - RNNS
 - Fully connected networks

Edge detection

 - CNN w/ different weights
 - First layer: Simple shapes
 - Second layer: More complex shapes

Sigmoid functions

 - Visualizaiton of multiple sigmoids and output space
 - Universal approx. function: Shallow network can approximate any function to arbitrary precision

Lab time

 - Set up machine w/ GPU (w/ CUDA)
 - Intro to [https://www.crestle.com](https://www.crestle.com)
 - Intro to iPython Notebooks
 - Lessons will be in PyTorch
 - His coding style in unique. Variable names are abbreviated
 - Free parameters
   - CNN architectures, learning rate and number of epochs
   - resnet34 is good starting point for computer vision
   - Cyclical learning rates for training neural networks: Provides guide for learning rate
   - Perform mini-batch training with variable learning rates. Pliot loss vs learning rate. Choose a valley
