## Chapter 1: The interview process

 - Overview of standard interview process
   - Goals: Measure analytical skills, coding skills, tech knowledge, experience and culture fit

 - Lack of response means nothing
 - It is common to re-apply to positions

## Chapter 2: Behind the scenes

 - Usual process: Tech screening, on site with multiple interviews
 - Case studies of interview processes at common large tech companies

## Chapter 3: Special situations

 - Experienced candidates: Less recent classword, more hands on experience
   - May or may not get algorithms questions
 - Unit testers: Lower coding expectations
 - PMs: Can be technical or non-technical
 - Dev Lead and managers: Emphasis on project scoping and management skills
 - Startups: Highly variable
   - Higher emphasis on building things and culture fit

## IV: Before the interview

 - Standard prep work
 - Flow chart from T-12 months to T+2 daysof interview

## V: Behavioral Questions

Interview prep: Have soundbite for each question for 3 projects.
 - Challenges
 - Mistakes/failures
 - Enjoyed
 - Leadership
 - Conflicts
 - What you'd do differently

General concepts
 - Know honest weaknesses, how you're improving on them
 - Questions for the interviewer: Be prepared
 - Know technical projects

Responding to BI questions

 - Be speific, limit scope, offer to dive deeper
 - Structure ansers
   - Nugget first, then describe, or
   - Situation, action, result
 - Mind character traits: Initiative / leadership, empathy, compassion, humility, teamwork / helpfulness

Tell me about yourself (general guidelines)

 - Current role (quick), college, grad school and onward. current role (in depth), hobbies, summary

## VI: Big O

Time complexity & space complexity

 - Big O: upper bound
 - Big Omega: lower bound
 - Big Theta: If O and Omega are the same, then that value is the Theta

Tricks

 - Amortized. E.g. array list X insertions take O(2x), while amortized time for each insertion is O(1)
 - Log N: Pops up when you halve work with each step
 - Recursive: Tends to be O(branches^{depth}), where branches are number of time recursive function is called in return line, and depth is recursion depth
