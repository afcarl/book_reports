# [A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820)

## First pass

Meta
 - CNNs require architecture optimization / black magic
 - One layer CNNs examined
 - Meant to provide practical advice / best starting architecture
 
Models
 - 9 text -> categorical classification data sets studied
 - Averaged word embeddings (Word2vec and glove embeddings)
 - SVM for baseline
 - Single region (CNN kernel?) size metrics
 - Multiple region size metrics
 - Notes on activation / pooling hyperparameters
 - Notes on regularization

Conclusion

 - List of exacting recommendations for hyperparameters
 - Limits scope to single sentence classification
